# 🚉 Strategic-Optimization-of-Mumbai-Suburban-Rail

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the **Mumbai Suburban Rail network**, one of the busiest suburban railway systems in the world. By leveraging data analytics, the project aims to identify overcrowded corridors, underutilized routes, and strategic interventions to improve efficiency, passenger experience, and resource allocation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze passenger flow and train frequency across the network  
- Identify bottlenecks and high-demand segments  
- Suggest optimal train schedules and infrastructure improvements  
- Provide actionable insights for urban planning and transport management  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The project utilizes datasets containing:
- Train schedules and frequency  
- Passenger volume by route and time  
- Station-wise traffic data  
- Demographic and geographic information of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region  

---

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, standardize formats, aggregate relevant features  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize traffic patterns, peak hours, and underutilized routes  
3. **Optimization Analysis** – Apply statistical and ML techniques for scheduling and resource allocation  
4. **Visualization & Reporting** – Dashboards, charts, and comprehensive reports
