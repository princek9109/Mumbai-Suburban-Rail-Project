# 📌 Project Overview

The Mumbai Suburban Rail Network is one of the busiest commuter rail systems in the world, serving 7M+ daily passengers.
This project presents a Strategic Optimization Plan to improve efficiency, capacity, and passenger experience through:

Infrastructure enhancements (track expansion, platform upgrades, junction station development)

Service optimization (express services, peripheral connectivity improvements, new stations)

Passenger experience improvements (real-time information, journey planning tools, last-mile connectivity)

Transit-oriented development to balance urban and peripheral growth.

# 🚉 Key Highlights

Current daily ridership: 7M+ passengers

Urban corridors (Western & Central lines) overcrowded; peripheral lines underutilized

Strategic opportunities in growth corridors (Dahanu–Virar–Panvel, Trans Harbour)

Recommendations include track capacity improvements, platform extensions, express service patterns, and integrated mobility hubs.



# 📊 Expected Outcomes

Higher peak-hour capacity

Reduced long-distance journey times

Improved on-time performance

Balanced utilization between urban and peripheral networks

Better commuter quality of life
