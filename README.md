# Strategic-Optimization-of-Mumbai-Suburban-Rail
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the Mumbai Suburban Rail network, one of the busiest suburban railway systems in the world. By leveraging data analytics, the project aims to identify overcrowded corridors, underutilized routes, and strategic interventions to improve efficiency, passenger experience, and resource allocation.

## Objectives
Analyze passenger flow and train frequency across the network.
Identify bottlenecks and high-demand segments.
Suggest optimal train schedules and infrastructure improvements.
Provide actionable insights for urban planning and transport management.
## Dataset
The project utilizes datasets containing:
Train schedules and frequency
Passenger volume by route and time
Station-wise traffic data
Demographic and geographic information of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region

## Methodology
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and aggregating relevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing traffic patterns, peak hours, and underutilized routes.
Optimization Analysis: Applying statistical and machine learning techniques to propose improvements in scheduling and resource allocation.
Visualization & Reporting: Presenting insights through dashboards, charts, and comprehensive reports.
